This assignment makes changes to the linux ext3 filesystem to enable the coordinates of the device to be saved to disk.
Whenever a file/directory/link is created, the coordinates of the device are saved into the inode of the disk. 

For testing purposes, we have created a filesystem 2MB in size and in it, there is a directory and a file and the 
directory holds another file. 

To test this, please compile our kernel, flash it to the device. Once the device has fully booted, please run
links.sh script and the filesystem will have been mounted to /data/misc/hmwk6 directory. All FS operations
should be functional in this filesystem. To check the coordinates of the file, please run file_loc with the
path to the file as an argument. 

The following is a sample output that we used to test.

/file_loc ./hmwk6/dir1:

Latitude: 40.808906	Longitude: -73.960621	Accuracy: 57.974998

URL: https://www.google.com/maps?&z=10&q=40.808906+--73.960621&ll=40.808906+-73.960621

./file_loc ./hmwk6/file1:
Latitude: 40.808905	Longitude: -73.960608	Accuracy: 46.821999

./file_loc ./hmwk6/file1 (after killing daemon and not updating data)
Latitude: 40.808905	Longitude: -73.960588	Accuracy: 45.467999

/file_loc ./hmwk6/dir1/file2 -- This was done at Nicolas' home                                                 
Latitude: 40.780837	Longitude: -73.972780	Accuracy: 21.190001
Age: 1
URL: https://www.google.com/maps?&z=10&q=40.780837+--73.972780&ll=40.780837+-73.972780

The age of the coordinates is updated accordingly and shown in seconds and the Google Maps link that is generated can
be pasted into the browser for viewing the location on Google Maps.
